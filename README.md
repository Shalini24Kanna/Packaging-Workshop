## LAB1: Thermal Simulation of Semiconductor Packages with ANSYS 

### Introduction And Getting Started With ANSYS Electronics Desktop

Instal ANSYS Electronics Desktop software. Then open Ansys EDT tool. 
If you cannot see all design file types. Go to tools -> Options -> General Options -> Desktop Configuration ->  ‘Set target configuration’ as ALL 


 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c9f89e1-2a7c-4efc-8f31-12e046e01fd9)



Open / click on Icepak tool

 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceabd390-2170-4dc1-8d40-d12cd022e69f)


Here, a Finite analysis is performed. So, a 3D model is made for thermal analysis where thermal flow is monitored using FlipChip BGA Package.

To import a Icepak FlipChip BGA Package, go to tool kit and packages as shown below

 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6687c2a5-c4a2-4a27-9f65-a62188b9ce58)



### Setting Up A Flip-Chip BGA Package

The FlipChip BGA Package details are as below 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec6fe130-a1e8-41af-928e-d25fc81dd92f)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e59259c0-88ab-480f-a487-430c7c95b672)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d6f8972-2c9c-41ee-b031-056aea4bfdae)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f3345a2-bb8f-484d-b2bf-51270a8baac9)


As the thermal analysis is done trough Icepak, a power source is given to the chip, which helps in observing the power distribution. Here, a silicon type material is used with Bump size 0.01mm 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9896de7c-b056-4ffd-9e6e-c37757ffb8be)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e31990f-cc7c-4501-8f2e-4b19df39678e)



### Material Definitions And Thermal Power Sources

The Icepak model using here:

FlipChip BGA Die
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4636e5fc-54d9-456f-a49c-6fd4fe6b8fcf)


Now, Thermal conditions are given to the chip. To add thermal conditions go to Icepak -> Thermal -> FlipChip BGA1_Die_source and add thermal condition as shown.

Die source on the chip

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16296252-5091-4f50-b3f0-0a1bfc3c7c0c)
 


For boundary conditions, a source is added to the package, the process to add thermal condition and the values are added as shown
  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8670b1f-6445-487d-a8cb-dfcbc80b87dc)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/777d65c5-02f0-49b8-bcfb-e6b158c0232c)


As there is a warning of source and boundary source overlap, boundary source is deleted.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f84f5a3d-420a-40b1-a542-5f0f542161a6)
 

The next step is to add monitors to Substrate, Die and Underfill.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3309acb-7723-4369-9fce-c8d67c28cbad)




### Meshing And Running The Thermal Analysis

Now, Mesh is added to the packaging. 
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7fc9038-656b-4cc1-a52c-7b7ef62274da)


Now when mesh is generated, there is a ‘Mesh Visualization’ tab pops up, here in quality tab parameters like Face alignment, Skewness and Volume can be observed. 

![10d- maesh Volume](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c354959-e62d-4353-9499-d26a29abc05e)
![10c- maesh skewness](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e381035-172d-452e-becf-04fe2308c887)
![10b- maesh face alignment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/964bbeaa-caaf-4e3c-aebd-26b820f9ca43)



For doing Analysis, a solution step is added with default settings
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8714544-e04d-48ab-8722-77ff5e6cc7e8)


At the top in simulations, click the ‘Validation’

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9c563e9-d105-4311-a8af-2cba3d444a76)

 
Validation only verifies that all checks are there in the design, it will not analyse the design. 

As, there is a warning for Underfill have no mesh region, it is added manually. When a mesh added manually, there are errors seen 

Mesh region adding manually process and its setting are as below:
  
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8570a50d-41f5-48d2-9382-3e0f40402d78)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f059afea-513d-4a4c-a76a-5da5a43c18a1)


The ‘Validation’ is re-run
 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9734ad3d-f34d-4d42-b0f4-fe6babb5b02a)


### Viewing Results And Exploring Other Package Types

Now, when ‘Analyze All’ is performed, now errors are seen due to manually added mesh region for Underfill region. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5913b394-6d9d-44db-b715-929c4cc26703)


So, to resolve the errors seen, the newly added mesh region is deleted. Then, Mesh generation process is re-performed to make sure there are no errors with it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f888be95-e830-4515-a438-ed713c35327c)
 


Now, ‘Validation’ and ‘Analyze all’ are performed and observed that errors are resolved.

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb7cd5ad-1091-4d84-8e42-2db9485b24a0)


Now, that Analysis is done. Next step is to plot the thermal plots. For that select the whole package, then right click -> Plot fields -> Temperature -> Temperature 

It opens a ‘Field plot’ tab

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/701a40b8-c439-48e0-9617-b29ff3effd3b)

 
In ‘Surface smoothing’ tab enable the Gaussian.

Now, Thermal plots are generated on the FlicpChip BGA Package
 
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d23848f-bbbb-4be7-8ff1-5d3308b7555f)


Here, the transition of thermal flow on the package from Substrate to Die and pins is analyzed.
